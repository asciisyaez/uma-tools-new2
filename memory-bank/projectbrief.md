# Project Brief

## Project Overview
Umalator is a web-based race simulator for the game Uma Musume: Pretty Derby. It allows users to simulate races, analyze skill activations, and visualize race dynamics using charts and graphs.

## Core Goals
- Provide accurate race simulations based on game mechanics.
- Visualize complex race data (velocity, position, skill activations).
- Enable comparison between different horse builds (Umamusume).
- Maintain a deployable version on GitHub Pages (`umalator-global`).

## Current Scope
- **Modernization**: Implement a modern, responsive UI (Glassmorphism, Dark Mode) alongside the Classic view.
- **Maintenance**: Fix bugs (e.g., broken images) and ensure the global build process (`umalator-global`) remains up to date with source changes (`umalator`).
- **Deployment**: Ensure `umalator-global` artifacts are correctly built and pushed to GitHub for hosting.
